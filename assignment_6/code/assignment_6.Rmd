## Packages to Install


**The packages used this week are**

* ggplot2
* xtable (build tables quickly)
* data.table (data tables are computationally efficient and IMHO easier to work with)


```{r,comment='\t\t',echo=FALSE}

## This is a code chunk: it is outlined in grey and has R code inside of it
## Note: you can change what is shown in the final .pdf document using arguments 
##       inside the curly braces at the top {r, comment='\t\t'}. For example, you 
##       can turn off print statements showing in the .pdf by adding 'echo=False' 
##       i.e. changing the header to {r, comment='\t\t',echo=FALSE}

## Problem 1 (Coding Exercise)

This exercise asks you to implement and assess the performance of the bootstrap for the linear regression model. Suppose you have the linear regression model:

\begin{align*}
  y_{i} = \beta_{0} + \beta_{1}x_{i} + \epsilon_{i}
\end{align*}

where,

\begin{itemize}
  \item[-] $x_{i} \sim U[0,2]$
  \item[-] $\epsilon_{i} \vert x_{i} \sim U[-1,1]$
  \item[-] $\beta_{0} = \beta_{1} = 1$ 
\end{itemize}

We ask you to answer the following questions:

\begin{itemize}
\item[a.] Write a code that generates i.i.d. samples of sizes $n=10,50,200$ from that distribution, computes (1) the least squares estimator for $\beta$, (2) the t-ratio for the least squares coefficient $\beta_{1}$, $t_{n} = \frac{\hat{\beta}_{1,LS} - 1}{\hat{s.e.}(\hat{\beta}_{1,LS})}$, and (3) the least square residuals $\hat{\epsilon}_{i} = y_{i} - \hat{\beta}_{0,LS} - \hat{\beta}_{1,LS} x_{i}$

\item[b.] Write a code for drawing $n$ times at random from the discrete uniform distribution over the estimated residuals $\hat{\epsilon}_{1},...,\hat{\epsilon}_{n}$ (i.e. with replacement).

\item[c.] Use your code from parts (a) and (b) to implement the residual bootstrap - assuming that $\epsilon_{i}$ and $x_{i}$ are independent - to estimate the 95th percentiles of the respective distributions of $\hat{\beta}_{1,LS}$ and $t_{n}$

\item[d.] Repeat part (a) for sample size $n=10,50,200$ with $200$ replications, where you keep the initial draws of $x_{1},..,x_{n}$ from part (a) and only generate new residuals from their conditional distribution. Compute $\hat{\beta}_{1,LS}$ and the statistic $t_{n}$ using $200$ independent samples of size $n$. Use your results to compute a simulated estimate for the 95th percentiles of the respective sampling distributions for $\hat{\beta}_{1,LS}$ and $t_{n}$.

\item[e.] Compare your results from (c) and (d). What do you conclude about the performance of the bootstrap? How does it compare to the 95th percentile of the asymptotic distribution of $t_{n}$?
\end{itemize}

## Problem 2 (Coding Exercise)

This exercise will walk you through a prediction task. I have downloaded data from a peer-to-peer lending platform, Lending Club. The dataset you will work with is: __lending_club_07_to_11_cleaned.csv__. Lending Club provides detailed characteristic information regarding loans, both information on the borrower, as well as, the loan itself. Your goal will be to build a model to predict the outcome of a loan, i.e. whether an individual paid off a loan or did not pay off a loan. In our case, a good outcome is if the loan is fully paid off, a bad outcome is if the loan is charged off. 

The target variable for the analysis is **loan_status**, where:

\begin{align*}
  loan\_status = 
    \begin{cases}
      1 \mbox{ if loan is paid off } \\
      0 \mbox{ if loan is not paid off }
    \end{cases}
\end{align*}

\begin{itemize}

\item[a.] This is going to be a more DIY style exercise, provide a list of the variables you plan to use for the analysis. Give a short discussion for why you excluded other variables.

\item[b.] Regularization is an important step when using an machine learning algorithm, regularzie the variables that you have included. Briefly, why is regularization important?

\item[c.] Provide a simple correlational table to give you a sense of the relationship between your covariates. Do you notice any interesting patterns?

\item[d.] Split the dataset into a single test and training set, a simple rule of thumb is an 40/60 split. How did you build these two sets?

\item[e.] Using your training set, run a logistic regression, a random forest, and a gradient boosted random forest. To show your results, present both a measure of miscalssification error, accuracy and a confusion matrix.

\item[f.] One easy way to improve model performance is cross-validation. Do a k-fold cross validation, where k=5, using the best performing model from part (e.). Re-report the misclassification error, accuracy and a confusion matrix. 

\end{itemize}
